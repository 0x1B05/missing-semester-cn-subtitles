1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,575
好,欢迎回来.
Okay, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:07,600
今天我们将讨论与 Shell 相关的两个主要主题.
Today we're gonna cover kind of a couple separate like two main topics related to the Shell.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,376
首先,我们将进行一些 Shell 脚本编写,主要涉及到 bash,
First, we're gonna do some kind of Shell scripting, mainly related to bash, 

4
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:18,875
这是 Mac 或像 Linux 系统中启动的默认 Shell.
which is the Shell that most of you will start like in Mac,   or like in most Linux systems, that's the default Shell.

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,650
它也与其他 Shell（如 zsh）兼容,非常实用.
And it's also kind of backward compatible through other Shells like zsh, it's pretty nice.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,450
然后,我们将介绍一些其他非常方便的 Shell 工具,
And then we're gonna cover some other Shell tools that are really convenient,

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,325
可以避免你做一些重复的任务,
so you avoid doing like really repetitive tasks,

8
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:33,350
例如查找某些代码或某些藏得很深的文件.
like looking for some piece of code or for some elusive file.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,700
Shell中一些内置命令已经非常有用,
And there are already kind of really nice built-in commands

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,550
可以帮助你完成这些任务.
that will kind of really help you to do those things.

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,475
昨天,我们已经介绍了 Shell 的一些特性,
So yesterday we already kind of introduced you to the Shell and kind of like it's quirks,

12
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:50,350
比如如何执行命令并对他们重定向等等.
and some like how you start executing commands,redirecting them.

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,375
Today, we're gonna kind of cover more about like the syntax of more   like the variables, the control flow,functions of the Shell.

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:57,500
今天,我们将更详细地介绍 Shell 的变量语法、流程控制和函数等内容.
Today, we're gonna kind of cover more about like the syntax of more   like the variables, the control flow,functions of the Shell.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,525
今天,我们将更详细地介绍 Shell 的变量语法、流程控制和函数等内容.

16
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:03,975
例如,一旦你进入 Shell,你可能想要定义一个变量,
So for example, once you kind of drop into a Shell, say you want to kind of define a variable, 

17
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:09,250
这是学习编程语言的第一步.
which is kind of one of the first things you learn to do in a programming language.

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,125
在这里,你可以执行类似foo=bar的操作.
Here you could do something like `foo=bar`.

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,775
现在,我们可以通过 "$foo" 来访问 "foo" 的值.
And now we can access the value of "foo" by doing "$foo".

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,850
结果为"bar",完美.
And that's "bar", perfect.

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,650
需要注意的一个问题是,
One quirk that you need to be aware of is that 

22
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,025
在使用bash的时候,空格非常关键.
spaces are really critical when you're dealing with bash.

23
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:33,500
主要是因为空格是用于分隔参数得保留字符.
Mainly because spaces are reserved, and that will be for separating arguments.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,526
因此,例如,foo = bar 将不起作用,
So, for example, something like "foo = bar" won't work, 

25
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:41,950
Shell 会告诉你为什么不起作用.
and the Shell is gonna tell you why it's not working. 

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,150
这是因为"foo"命令并没有执行,例如这里提示说"foo"不存在.
It's because the "foo" command is not working, like "foo" is non-existent.

27
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,925
事实上,我们并没有把"foo"分配到"bar"
And here what is actually happening, we're not assigning "foo" to "bar",

28
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:56,575
换句话说,我们调用"foo"程序时,第一个参数是"=",第二个参数是"bar".
what is happening is we're calling the "foo" program with the first argument "=" and the second argument "bar".

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,700
通常情况下,当你遇到一些问题时,例如一些带有空格的文件时,
And in general, whenever you are having some issues, like some files with spaces

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,203
需要小心处理.
you will need to be careful about that.

31
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:10,525
注意要用引号把含空格得字符串引起来.
You need to be careful about quoting strings.

32
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:14,350
接下来,我们将讨论在 bash 中如何使用字符串.
So, going into that, how you do strings in bash. 

33
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,700
有两种方法可以定义字符串：
There are two ways that you can define a string:

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,900
你可以使用双引号("")定义字符串,
You can define strings using double quotes 

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,000
也可以使用单引号（''）定义字符串.
and you can define strings using single,

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,275
错辣,
Sorry,

37
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,775
是用单引号('')
using single quotes.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,900
对于纯文本字符串,它们是等效的,
However, for literal strings they are equivalent,

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,550
但对于有些情况则不然.
but for the rest they are not equivalent.

40
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:43,200
例如,如果我们执行 echo "Value is $foo",
So, for example, if we do `echo "Value is $foo"`,

41
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,783
则会将 "$foo" 展开为字符串,
The "$foo" has been kind of expanded like a string 

42
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:51,125
并将其替换为 Shell中 "foo"的值.
substituted to the value of the "foo" variable in the Shell. 

43
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:58,900
而如果我们使用单引号,则就仅仅是 "$foo",
Whereas if we do this with single quotes, we are just getting the "$foo" as it is

44
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:01,850
即单引号不会进行替换.
and like single quotes won't be replacing.

45
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,354
写一个bash脚本真得轻轻松松,
And again,it's really easy to write a script, 

46
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:08,350
这类似于你可能更熟悉的 Python,
assume that this is kind of like Python, that you might be more familiar with,  

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,774
只是你暂时还没有意识到这一点.
and not realize all that.

48
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:14,350
这就是你给变量赋值的方式.
And this is the way you will assign variables.

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,925
然后,bash 还可以进行流程控制,例如 for 循环、while 循环,
Then bash also has control flow techniques that we'll see later,like for loops, while loops, 

50
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:23,450
更主要的是你可以定义函数.
and one main thing is you can define functions.

51
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,325
我们可以调用我在这里定义的一个函数
And we can access like a function I have defined here.

52
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:32,400
我们可以访问此处定义的"mcd"函数.
And here we have the "mcd" function, that has been defined, 

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,737
目前为止,我们只是演示了
and the thing is, so far, we have just kind of seen 

54
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:38,931
通过将多个命令使用管道传输来执行这些命令,
how to execute several commands by piping into them, 

55
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,200
昨天已经简要介绍了这个.
kind of saw that briefly yesterday.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,150
但是在很多情况下,你会想先执行一件事,然后再做另一件事.
But a lot of times you want to do first one thing and then another thing.

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,100
这就像我们这里的这个按序执行的例子一样.
And that's kind of like the sequential execution that we get here.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,075
例如,在这里,我们调用了"mcd"函数.
Here, for example, we're calling the "mcd" function.

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:02,625
我们首先调用mkdir命令来创建这个目录.
And we, first,are calling the "mkdir" command, which is like creating this directory.

60
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,175
在这里,"$1"是一种特殊变量.
Here, "$1" is like a special variable.

61
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:12,175
这是bash的一种特性,类似于其他脚本语言里的"argv",
This is the way that bash works,whereas in other scripting languages there will be like "argv",

62
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:16,775
"argv"第一项将包含该参数.
the first item of the array "argv" will contain the argument.

63
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:18,125
在bash中,它被表示为"$1".
In bash it's "$1". 

64
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:22,320
通常,在bash中,有许多"$"开头的东西,
And in general, a lot of things in bash will be "$..."

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,750
这表明它们是保留关键字.稍后我们会看到更多例子.
and will be reserved, we will be seeing more examples later.

66
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:30,675
一旦我们创建了文件夹,我们就进入进入该文件夹,
And once we have created the folder, we cd into that folder,

67
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:34,550
这是一种相当常见的流程.
which is kind of a fairly common pattern that you will see.

68
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,375
我们可以在Shell中直接输入这个命令,
We will actually type this directly into our Shell, 

69
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,450
它会定义该函数并起作用.
and it will work  and it will define this function.  

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,126
但是,有时将这些内容写入文件会更好.
But sometimes it's nicer to kind of write things in a file.

71
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,801
我们可以使用source mcd.sh
What we can do is we can source this. 

72
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:54,050
并在我们的Shell中加载并执行这个脚本.
And that will execute this script in our Shell and load it.

73
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,360
现在看起来好像什么都没有发生,
So now it looks like nothing happened, 

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,525
但是我们的Shell中已经定义了"mcd"函数.
but now the "mcd" function has been defined in our Shell. 

75
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:05,225
我们现在可以执行"mcd test"命令来试试,
So we can now for example do like "mcd test", 

76
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:09,675
然后我们从"tools"目录移动到"test"目录.
and now we move from the "tools" directory to the "test" directory. 

77
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:13,675
我们先创建了文件夹,然后进入了它.
We both created the folder and we moved into it.

78
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,875
还有什么?
What else. So a result is...

79
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,275
我们可以使用"$1"来访问第一个参数.
We can access the first argument with "$1".

80
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:26,475
还有很多保留命令,
There's a lot more kind of  reserved commands for example,

81
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,950
例如"$0"表示脚本的名称,
"$0" will be the name of the script,

82
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:37,125
"$2"到"$9"将是bash脚本接收的第二到第九个参数.
"$2" through "$9" will be the second through the ninth arguments that the bash script takes.  

83
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:42,225
其中一些保留关键字可以直接在Shell中使用,
Some of these reserved keywords can be directly used in the Shell, 

84
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:50,300
例如"$?"可以获取上一个命令的错误代码,
so for example "$?" will get you the error code from the previous command,

85
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,900
这个我等会会简要解释一下.
and which I'll also explain briefly.

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,275
例如"$_"可以获取上一个命令的最后一个参数.
But for example, "$_ " will get you the last argument of the previous command.

87
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:07,325
因此,我们也可以这样做,例如使用mkdir test,
So another way we could have done this is we could have said like "mkdir test"

88
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,802
而不需要重复输入"test",
and instead of rewriting test, 

89
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:14,282
我们可以使用"$_"作为上一个命令的一部分来访问上一个参数,
we can access that last argument as part of the (previous command),

90
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:22,675
这样它将被替换为"test",然后我们进入"test".
using "$_" ,like that will be replaced with "test" and now we go into "test".

91
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,675
还有很多这样的命令,你应该熟悉它们.
There are a lot of them, you should familiarize with them.

92
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:31,975
我经常使用的另一个命令叫做"!!",
Another one I often use is kind of is called "bang bang" ("!!"), 

93
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,650
当你尝试创建某些东西时但没有足够权限的时候,它就很有用.
you will run into this whenever you, for example,   are trying to create something and you don't have enough permissions. 

94
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,070
然后,你可以执行sudo !!命令,
Then, you can do "sudo !!" 

95
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,825
然后它将替换其中的命令,现在你可以尝试执行该命令.
and then that will replace the command in there and now you can just try doing that. 

96
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,000
现在它会提示你输入密码,因为你拥有sudo权限.
And now it will prompt you for a password,because you have sudo permissions.

97
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,300
之前,我提到了命令出错.
Before, I mentioned the kind of the error command.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,958
昨天我们提到,进程可以通过不同的方式
Yesterday we saw that, in general, there are like different ways 

99
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,825
与其他进程或命令进行通信.
a process can communicate with other processes or commands.

100
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,709
我们提过标准输入(流),
We mentioned the standard input, 

101
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:13,900
这个不像从标准输入流中读取或是输出到标准输出流
which also was less than like getting stuff through the standard input,   putting stuff into the standard output.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,250
这里有很多有意思的东西,比如说标准错误流,
There are a couple more interesting things, there's also like a standard error,

103
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,858
它用于在程序编写时输出错误信息,
a stream where you write errors that happen with your program 

104
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,075
以避免污染标准输出.
and you don't want to pollute the standard output.

105
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:29,365
还有错误代码这种东西,这是许多编程语言中都有的,
There's also the error code, which is like a general thing in a lot of programming languages, 

106
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:34,700
它可以报告程序的整体运行情况.
some way of reporting how the entire run of something went.

107
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,825
因此,如果我们执行像echo "hello"这样的命令,
So if we do  something like 'echo "hello"' 

108
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:43,325
并且检查其错误代码,它将为0.
and we like query for the value, it's zero.

109
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:46,850
这是因为一切都很顺利,没有出现任何问题.
And it's "zero" because everything went okay and there weren't any issues. 

110
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,916
"0"的退出代码与C语言中的退出代码相同,
And a "0" exit code is the same as you will get in a language like c, 

111
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:54,900
例如"0"表示一切顺利,没有错误.
like "0" means everything went fine, there were no errors.

112
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,450
但是,有时事情并不按照我们预期的方式进行.
However, sometimes things won't work.

113
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:04,850
例如,如果我们执行grep foobar mcd.sh,
Sometimes, like if we try to "grep" for "foobar" in our "mcd.sh",

114
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,800
然后检查其错误代码,它将为1.
and now we check for that value, it's "1". 

115
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,750
这是因为我们试图在"mcd.sh"中搜索"foobar"字符串,
And that's because we tried to search for the "foobar" string in the "mcd.sh" 

116
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,900
但是该字符串不存在.
and it wasn't there.

117
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,320
因此,"grep"不会输出任何内容,
So "grep" doesn't print anything, 

118
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,925
但是会返回一个1的错误代码告诉我们发生了错误.
but let us know that things didn't work by giving us a "1" error code.

119
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:30,550
还有一些有趣的命令,比如"true",它的错误代码始终为"0",
There are some interesting commands like "true", for example, will always have a "0" error code, 

120
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,075
而"false"的错误代码始终为1.
and "false" will always have a "1" error code.

121
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:43,150
通过使用这些逻辑运算符,我们可以执行某些条件语句.
Then there are like these logical operators that you can use to do some sort of conditionals for example

122
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,600
例如,你还可以用"if-else",这个我们稍后再说
one way...you also have "if"s and "else"s, that we will see later, 

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,250
你可以输入一些命令,例如false || echo 'Oops fail'
But you can do something like "false", and 'echo "Oops fail" '.

124
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,300
这里,我们使用"||"(或)运算符连接两个命令
So here we have two commands connected by this "||" operator.

125
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,725
然后在这里,bash会执行第一个命令
What bash is gonna do here, it's gonna execute the first one

126
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:06,075
如果第一个命令失败,则bash将执行第二个命令.
and if the first one didn't work, then it's gonna execute the second one. 

127
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:10,475
所以在这里我们得到了这个结果,因为它是一个逻辑或.
So here we get it,because it's gonna try to do a logical OR. 

128
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:14,525
如果第一个命令失败,则bash将执行第二个命令.
If the first one didn't have a "0" error code, it's gonna try to do the second one. 

129
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:19,675
同样的,如果我们不用false,我们用true
Similarly, if we instead of use "false", we use something like "true",

130
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,134
因为执行true不会报错,
since "true" will have a "0" error code, 

131
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:27,234
第二个命令就会跳过(短路)并且不会打印出来
then the second one will be short-circuited and it won't be printed.

132
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,877
同样,使用与运算符连接两个命令时,
Similarly, we have an AND operator 

133
00:09:35,877 --> 00:09:42,175
只有在第一个命令没有错误的情况下才会执行第二个命令.
which will only execute the second part if the first one ran without errors.

134
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:45,100
和之前(逻辑或)一样,
And the same thing will happen.

135
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,825
如果第一个命令失败,则bash将不会执行第二个命令.
If the first one fails, then the second part of this thing won't be executed.

136
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:58,400
此外,无论执行什么命令,
Kind of not exactly related to that, but another thing that you will see is

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,062
都可以使用";"将它们连接在同一行中,
that no matter what you execute, then you can concatenate commands

138
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,137
并将它们打印出来.
using a semicolon in the same line,and that will always print.

139
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:13,461
除此之外,例如我们现在还不知道
Beyond that, what we haven't seen, for example, 

140
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:19,475
如何将一个命令的输出存储到一个变量中.
is how you go about kind of getting the output of a command into a variable.

141
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:24,300
我们可以通过这样做来实现.
And the way we can do that is doing something like this.

142
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,451
在这里,我们获取了pwd命令的输出,
What we're doing here is we're getting the output of the "pwd" command,

143
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:33,900
该命令只是打印我们现在所在的当前工作目录,
which is just printing the present working directory where we are right now.

144
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,175
然后将其存储到"foo"变量中.
And then we're storing that into the "foo" variable.

145
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:42,575
然后我们查看一下"foo",我们就能看到我们所在的当前的工作目录.
So we do that and then we ask for "foo", we view our string.

146
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,925
更一般地说,
And more generally, 

147
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:51,725
我们可以通过将它放入任何字符串中来执行这个"命令替换"[*].
we can do this thing called command substitution by putting it into any string.
*[命令替换是一种在Unix、Linux和类Unix操作系统中常见的技术，用于在一个命令的输出中嵌套另一个命令。]

148
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:55,515
由于我们使用的是双引号("")而不是单引号(''),
And since we're using double quotes instead of single quotes

149
00:10:55,515 --> 00:11:02,450
这个东西将被扩展,并告诉我们我们在这个文件夹中.
that thing will be expanded and it will tell us that we are in this working folder.

150
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,950
另一个有趣的事情是,
Another interesting thing is, 

151
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,034
现在,这个东西正在扩展为一个字符串,而不是...emm,
right now, what this is expanding to is a string instead of kind of like, 

152
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:13,375
它只是扩展为一个字符串.
it's just expanding as a string.

153
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:19,867
另一个小众的工具称为进程替换,它有点和命令替换类似.
Another nifty and lesser known tool is called process substitution which is kind of similar. 

154
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,975
怎么做呢.
What it will do...

155
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:31,350
它会在这里,例如,"<",一些命令和另一个括号,
It will, here for example, the "<", some command and another parenthesis,

156
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,750
它的作用是,它会内部执行,然后将输出放到
what that will do is, that will execute, that will get the output to

157
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,525
一个类似临时文件的东西中,并将文件标识符提供给最左边命令.
kind of like a temporary file and it will give the file handle to the command.

158
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,500
所以在这里,我们正在获取...
So here what we're doing is we're getting...

159
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,800
我们正在查看这个目录,
we're LS'ing the directory, putting it into a temporary file,

160
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,036
将其放入一个临时文件中,对父文件夹做同样的事情,
doing the same thing for the parent folder 

161
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:50,500
然后将两个文件连接起来.
and then we're concatenating both files. 

162
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,883
这可能非常方便,
And this will, might be really handy, 

163
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:57,950
因为一些命令不是从标准输入流中获得输入输入参数,
because some commands instead of expecting the input coming from the stdin,

164
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,575
而是来自某些文件.
they are expecting things to come from   some file that is giving some of the arguments.

165
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,150
所以我们得到了两个连接在一起的命令.
So we get kind of both things concatenated.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,238
我认为到目前为止已经讲了不少东西,
I think so far there's been a lot of information, 

167
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:16,988
让我们看一个简单的脚本示例,
let's see kind of a simple, 

168
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:22,800
在其中我们可以看到一些这些东西的应用.
an example script where we see a few of these things.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,475
例如在这里我们有一个字符串和一个"$(date)".
So for example here we have a string and we have kind of this "$(date)". 

170
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:31,050
"$(date)"是一个程序.
So "$(date)" is a program.

171
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,050
UNIX中有很多程序,你将慢慢地熟悉.
Again there's a lot of programs in UNIX you will kind of slowly familiarize with a lot of them.

172
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,800
date只是打印当前日期,你可以指定不同的格式.
Date just prints what the current date is and you can specify different formats.

173
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,673
接下来,我们有这些"$0".
Then, we have these "$0" here. 

174
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:50,525
"$0"是我们正在运行的脚本的文件名.
"$0" is the name of the script that we're running.

175
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:57,575
然后我们有"$#",这是我们给该命令的参数数量,
Then we have "$#", that's the number of arguments that we are giving to the command,

176
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:02,325
然后"$$"是正在运行的该命令的进程ID[*].
and then "$$" is the process ID of this command that is running.
*[也简称PID]

177
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:06,500
再次提醒,这里有很多"$"符号,它们不直观,
Again, there's a lot of kind of these dollar things, they're not intuitive 

178
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,175
因为它们没有一种助记的记忆方式,比如"$#".
because they don't have like a mnemonic way of remembering, maybe, "$#".

179
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:14,525
但是用得多了就会逐渐熟悉它们.
But it can be... you will just be seeing them and getting familiar with them.

180
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:19,175
这里我们有"$@",它将展开为所有的参数.
Here we have this "$@", and that will expand to all the arguments.

181
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:26,100
因此,不必假定可能有三个参数而编写"$1","$2","$3",
So, instead of having to assume that, maybe say,   we have three arguments and writing "$1", "$2", "$3",

182
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,925
如果我们不知道有多少参数,我们可以将所有这些参数放在那里.
if we don't know how many arguments we can put all those arguments there.

183
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,153
然后将其传递给for循环.
And that has been given to a for loop. 

184
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:39,377
for循环将依次创建"file"变量,
And the for loop will, in time, get like the file variable 

185
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:48,100
并将每个参数逐一赋值给"file".
and it will be giving each one of the arguments.   So what we're doing is, for every one of the arguments we're giving. 

186
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,612
接下来,在下一行中,我们运行"grep"命令,
Then, in the next line we're running the "grep" command

187
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,850
它只是在某个文件中搜索子字符串,
which is just search for a substring in some file 

188
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,450
这里我们在文件中搜索字符串"foobar".
and we're searching for the string "foobar" in the file.

189
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,413
我们将"file"变量展开.
Here, we kind of have put the variable that the file took to expand.

190
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:11,484
昨天,如果我们关心程序的输出,
And yesterday we saw that like if we care about the output of a program,

191
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:16,200
我们可以将其重定向到某个地方,以保存它或连接到其他文件.
we can redirect it to somewhere to save it or like to connect it to some other file.

192
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,075
但是有时候我们想要相反的效果.
But sometimes you want the opposite.

193
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,225
有时,例如在这里,我们关注...
Sometimes, here for example, we care...

194
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,175
我们需要关注错误代码.
we're gonna care about the error code. 

195
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:28,200
对于这个脚本,我们需要关心"grep"命令是否成功运行.
About this script, we're gonna care whether the "grep" ran successfully or it didn't.

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,661
因此,我们实际上可以完全忽略输出就像...
So we can actually discard entirely what the output like

197
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:37,825
就像"grep"命令的标准输出流和标准错误流一样.
like both the standard output and the standard error of the "grep" command.

198
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:42,925
我们要做的是将输出重定向到"/dev/null",
And what we're doing is we're redirecting the output to "/dev/null" 

199
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:50,550
这是UNIX系统中的一种特殊设备,
which is kind of like a special device in UNIX systems where you can like write and it will be discarded. 

200
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,500
你可以像写入文件一样写入数据,但它将被丢弃.
Like you can write no matter how much you want there, and it will be discarded. 
[就像黑洞一样~]

201
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,225
这里有一个">"符号,我们昨天已经知道它用于重定向.
And here's the ">" symbol that we saw yesterday for redirecting output. 

202
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:05,500
这里有一个"2>",正如一些人可能已经猜到的那样,
Here you have a "2>" and, as some of you might have guessed by now, 

203
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,550
这是用于重定向标准错误流的,
this is for redirecting the standard error, 

204
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,275
因为这两个流是分开的,
because those two streams are separate, 

205
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,750
你需要告诉bash如何处理它们.
and you kind of have to tell bash what to do with each one of them.

206
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,300
所以在这里,我们检查文件是否包含"foobar",
So here, we run, we check if the file has "foobar", 

207
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,575
如果文件包含"foobar",它将返回0.
and if the file has "foobar" then it's going to have a "0" code. 

208
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:25,750
如果没有foobar,它将返回非0的错误代码.
If it doesn't have foobar, it's gonna have a nonzero error code. 

209
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,125
因此,这正是我们检查的内容.
So that's exactly what we check in this 

210
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:33,050
在这个if命令的一部分中,我们说"给我错误代码".
"if" part of the command we say "get me the error code". 

211
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,250
这里用了"$?"
Again, this "$?".

212
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,700
然后我们有一个比较运算符:
And then we have a comparison operator:

213
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,800
"-ne",表示"non equal"(不相等).
which is "-ne", for "non equal". 

214
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:47,450
有些其他编程语言将有"=="、"！="这些符号.
And like some other programming languages will have "==", "!=", 

215
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,550
在bash中还有一系列的比较运算符,
these symbols in bash there's kind of like a reserved set of comparisons 

216
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,675
这主要是因为你可能需要测试很多东西
and it's mainly because there's a lot of things you might want to test for 

217
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:58,575
当你在shell中进行测试时,
when you're in the Shell. 

218
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:03,800
例如,在这里,我们只是检查两个整数值是否相同.
Here for example we're just checking for the two values, two integer values, being the same. 

219
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,050
或者例如在这里,"-f"检查将让我们知道文件是否存在,
Or for example here, the "-f" check will let us know if a file exists, 

220
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,800
这是你经常会遇到的一些事情.
which is something that you will run into very,very commonly. 

221
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,450
我回到这个例子.
I'm going back to the example. 

222
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:27,489
当文件没有"foobar"时会发生什么,
Then, what happens when we,if the file did not have "foobar", 

223
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,325
就会返回非零错误代码,
like there was a nonzero error code,

224
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:34,650
接着会打印:"这个文件中没有'foobar',我们将添加一个".
then we print: this file doesn't have any "foobar",we're going to add one. 

225
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:42,350
我们所做的是echo "# foobar",希望这是对文件的注释,
And what we do is we echo this "# foobar", hoping this is a comment to the file 

226
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,350
然后我们使用运算符">>"在文件末尾追加.
and then we're using the operator ">>" to append at the end of the file. 

227
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,450
因为文件名已经被传递给脚本,
Here since the file has been fed through the script, 

228
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,250
我们之前不知道文件名,所以我们用了"file"变量,现在要将它展开.
and we don't know it beforehand, we have to substitute the variable of the filename. 

229
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:02,000
我们可以运行这个脚本.
We can actually run this. 

230
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,900
我们已经在这个脚本中具有正确的权限,我们可以举出一些例子.
We already have correct permissions in this script and we can give a few examples. 

231
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,950
在此文件夹中,我们有一些文件,"mcd.sh"是我们在开头看到的"mcd"函数,
We have a few files in this folder, "mcd.sh" is the one we saw at the beginning for the "mcd" function, 

232
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:20,175
还有一些其他的脚本函数,我们甚至可以将自己的脚本输入到自己中,
some other "script" function and we can even feed the own script to itself to check 

233
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,850
以检查它是否包含"foobar".
if it has "foobar" in it.

234
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:31,575
然后我们运行它,首先可以看到许多已经被扩展了的变量.
And we run it and first we can see that there's different variables that we saw,   that have been successfully expanded. 

235
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:36,350
我们有date命令,已经被替换为当前时间,
We have date that has been replaced to the current time, 

236
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,125
然后我们传递三个参数给这个程序,
then we're running this program, with three arguments, 

237
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,400
这是随机生成的PID[*],
this randomized PID, 
*[PID代表进程标识符(Process Identifier)。  每个运行中的进程都有一个唯一的PID，用于在操作系统中标识该进程。]

238
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,550
然后它告诉我们"mcd"没有任何"foobar",所以我们正在添加一个新的,
and it's telling us "mcd" doesn't have any "foobar", so we are adding a new one,

239
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,025
这个脚本文件没有一个"foobar".
and this script file doesn't have one. 

240
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:56,025
现在让我们来看看"mcd.sh",它有我们需要的"foobar"注释.
So now for example let's look at "mcd" and it has the comment that we were looking for.

241
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:04,750
当你执行脚本时,还有一件事需要知道,
One other thing to know when you're kind of executing scripts 

242
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,000
就是这里有三个完全不同的参数,
is that here we have like three completely different arguments 

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,675
但通常你会给出一些更简洁的参数.
but very commonly you will be given arguments   that can be more succinctly given in some way.

244
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:25,200
例如,在这里,如果我们想引用所有的".sh"脚本,
So for example here if we wanted to refer to all the ".sh" scripts 

245
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,000
我们可以做一些像ls *.sh的事情,
we could just do something like "ls *.sh"

246
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,946
这是大多数shell都有的一种文件名扩展方式.
and this is a way of kind of filename expansion that most Shells have

247
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,275
称为"globbing"(通配符)的
 that's called "globbing". 

248
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:40,925
在这里,正如你所想,
Here, as you might expect, this is gonna say anything 

249
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:45,125
这将显示任何具有任何以".sh"结尾的内容.
that has any kind of sort of characters and ends up with ".sh".

250
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,750
显然,我们确实得到了"example.sh"和"mcd.sh".
Unsurprisingly, we get "example.sh" and "mcd.sh". 

251
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:54,050
我们还有这些"project1"和"project2",
We also have these "project1" and "project2", 

252
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,050
如果有一个...
and if there were like a... 

253
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,375
我们可以做一个"project42",
we can do a "project42", for example

254
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,559
例如,现在如果我们只想得到"project"后面只有一个字符,而不是两个字符的
And now if we just want to refer to the projects that have a single character, but not two characters afterwards,

255
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:10,400
像任何其他字符一样,我们可以使用"?".
like any other characters,we can use the question mark. 

256
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,375
所以"?"将扩展为一个任意字符.
So "?" will expand to only a single one.

257
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:20,525
我们得到，lsing，第一个是"project1"然后是"project2"
And we get, lsing, first "project1" and then "project2".

258
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:27,700
通常情况下,通配符可以非常强大.你也可以结合使用.
Another kind of the...globbing can be very powerful. You can also combine it.

259
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,050
就是使用所谓的花括号("\{\}").
A common pattern is to use what is called curly braces.

260
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,525
假设我们有一个图像,在这个文件夹中,
So let's say we have an image, that we have in this folder

261
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:43,850
我们想将这个图像从PNG转换为JPG,
and we want to convert this image from PNG to JPG

262
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,975
或者我们可以复制它,
or we could maybe copy it, 

263
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:49,625
这是一个非常常见的情况,有两个或更多相似的参数,
or it's a really common pattern, to have two or more arguments 

264
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:55,150
你想将它们作为参数传递给某个命令.
that are fairly similar and you want to do something with them   as arguments to some command.

265
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,763
你可以这样做,你也可以用更加简介的方式
You could do it this way, or more succinctly, 

266
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:08,850
你只要输入"image.\{png,jpg\}"就可以了
you can just do "image.{png,jpg}"

267
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,675
在这里,我得到了一些彩色的反馈.
And here, I'm getting some color feedback. 

268
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:17,575
反正它会扩展为上面那行.
but what this will do, is expand into the line above.

269
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:23,175
实际上,我可以让zsh替我做到这一点.
Actually, I can ask zsh to do that for me and that what's happening here.

270
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,125
这真的很nice.
This is really powerful. 

271
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,475
例如,你可以做一些像...
So for example you can do something like... 

272
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:34,250
我们可以"touch"一串"foo",所有这些都会被扩展.
we could do "touch" on a bunch of "foo"s, and all of this will be expanded.

273
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:42,425
你还可以多层操作,他们将做笛卡尔积...
You can also do it at several levels and you will do the Cartesian...

274
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,650
如果我们有一些这样的组,
We have something like this, we have one group here, 

275
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,525
"\{1,2\}",然后这里有"\{1,2,3\}",
"{1,2}" and then here there's "{1,2,3}", 

276
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,600
这将以这两个组的笛卡尔积进行扩展,
and this is going to do the Cartesian product of these two expansions 

277
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,425
并将扩展为所有这些东西,我们可以快速地创建文件.
and it will expand into all these things,that we can quickly "touch".

278
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:10,825
你还可以将"*" 通配符与"\{\}" 通配符结合使用.
You can also combine the asterisk glob with the curly braces glob.

279
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,900
你甚至可以使用类似于区间的东西.
You can even use kind of ranges.

280
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,910
比如,我们可以做"mkdir",
Like, we can do "mkdir"

281
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,025
并创建"foo"和"bar"目录,
and we create the "foo" and the "bar" directories, 

282
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:25,275
然后我们可以做类似这样的事情.
and then we can do something along these lines. 

283
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:31,700
这将会扩展到 "fooa", "foob"... 所有这些组合,一直到 "j",
This is going to expand to "fooa", "foob" like all these combinations, through "j", 

284
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,275
然后对于 "bar" 同样如此.
and then the same for "bar". 

285
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,023
我还没有真正测试过它... 
I haven't really tested it... 

286
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:40,150
但是是的,我们得到了所有这些我们可以"touch"的组合.
but yeah, we're getting all these combinations that we can "touch".

287
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:47,700
现在,如果我们接触到这两个目录之间不同的东西,
And now, if we touch something that is different between these two (directories), 

288
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:56,326
我们可以再次展示我们之前的进程替换.
we can again showcase the process substitution that we saw earlier. 

289
00:21:56,326 --> 00:22:00,450
比如我们想检查这两个文件夹之间有哪些文件不同.
So  we want to check what files are different between these two folders.

290
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,425
对于我们来说很明显,我们刚刚看到了,是 "x" 和 "y",
For us it's obvious, we just saw it, it's "x" and "y",

291
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:06,946
但是我们可以要求 shell 进行"diff",
but we can ask the Shell to do this "diff" for us 

292
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:09,900
并且要求它在两个 "ls" 的输出之间
between the output of one "ls" and the other "ls".

293
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,308
毫不奇怪,我们得到的结果是:
Unsurprisingly we're getting: 

294
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:14,155
"x" 只存在于第一个文件夹中,
"x" is only in the first folder 

295
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:18,180
而 "y" 只存在于第二个文件夹中.
and "y" is only in the second folder. 

296
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:25,400
我们现在只看到了 bash 脚本.
What is more is, right now, we have only seen bash scripts. 

297
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,047
如果你喜欢其他脚本,
If you like other scripts,

298
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:31,600
对于某些任务,bash 可能不是最好的,可能会很棘手.
 like for some tasks bash is probably not the best,it can be tricky. 

299
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,875
你实际上可以用许多不同语言来实现与 shell 交互的脚本.
You can actually write scripts that interact with the Shell implemented in a lot of different languages. 

300
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,075
所以,例如,让我们看一下这里.
So for example, let's see here...

301
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:46,025
一个 Python 脚本,在开头有一个魔法行,我现在不解释.
Python script that has a magic line at the beginning that I'm not explaining for now.

302
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,350
然后我们有"import sys",
Then we have "import sys",

303
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,737
它有点像...... 
it's kind of like the... 

304
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:55,916
Python 默认情况下不会尝试与 shell 交互,
Python is not, by default, trying to interact with the Shell, 

305
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,900
所以你需要导入一些库.
so you will have to import some library. 

306
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:06,624
然后我们正在做一件非常愚蠢的事情,就是迭代"sys.argv [1:]".
And then we're doing a really silly thing of just iterating over "sys.argv[1:]".

307
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:13,150
"sys.argv" 有点类似于在 bash 中我们得到的 "$0","$1" 等,
"sys.argv" is kind of similar to what in bash we're getting as "$0", "$1",etc

308
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,250
就像参数向量一样,我们将其按相反的顺序打印出来.
Like the vector of the arguments, we're printing it in the reversed order.

309
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,300
开头的魔法行叫做 shebang,
And the magic line at the beginning is called a shebang 

310
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,525
是让shell知道如何运行这个脚本.
and is the way that the Shell will know how to run this program.

311
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:33,575
你总是可以做一些像"python script.py"这样的事情,然后"a b c",
Like you can always do something like "python script.py", and then like "a b c" 

312
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,300
这样始终可以运行.
and that will work, always, like that. 

313
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,925
但是,如果我们想让它在 shell 中直接执行呢? 
But what if we want to make this to be executable from the Shell? 

314
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:45,277
shell 知道它必须使用 python 作为解释器
The way the Shell knows that it has to use python as the interpreter 

315
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:50,550
这样才能通过shebang的方式来运行此文件.
to run this file is using that first line. 

316
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:56,275
shebang展示的就是运行这个脚本的程序所在路径.
And that first line is giving it the path to where that thing lives.

317
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:00,225
但是,你可能不知道.
However, you might not know,like, 

318
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:04,100
不同的机器可能会将 python 放在不同的位置,
different machines will have probably different places where they put python

319
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,243
你可能无法提前知道 python 或者其他解释器安装在哪里.
and you might not want to assume where python is installed, or any other interpreter.

320
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:17,525
所以你可以使用"env".
So one thing that you can do is use the "env" command.

321
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,598
你也可以在 shebang 中给出参数,
You can also give arguments in the shebang, 

322
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:26,273
所以我们在这里指定运行"env"命令,
so what we're doing here is specifying run the "env" command, 

323
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:29,550
对于几乎所有系统来说,有一些例外,
that is for pretty much every system, there are some exceptions, 

324
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,057
但是对于几乎所有系统来说,
but like for pretty much every system 

325
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:34,375
它都在"usr/bin"中,那里有很多二进制文件,
it's is in "usr/bin", where a lot of binaries live,

326
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,450
然后我们用参数"python"调用它
and then we're calling it with the argument "python". 

327
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,625
然后它将利用我们在第一节课上学到的路径环境变量.
And then that will make use of the path environment variable that we saw in the first lecture. 

328
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,500
它将在该路径中搜索Python二进制文件,
It's gonna search in that path for the Python binary 

329
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,875
然后使用它来解释该文件.
and then it's gonna use that to interpret this file. 

330
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,704
这将使得它的可移植性变强了,
And that will make this more portable 

331
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:56,854
因此这个脚本可以在我的电脑、你的电脑和其他电脑上运行.
so it can be run in my machine, and your machine and some other machine.

332
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,350
另一件事是,bash并不现代化,
Another thing is that the bash is not really like modern, 

333
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,025
它是很久以前开发的.
it was developed a while ago. 

334
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:18,375
有时调试起来可能会很棘手.
And sometimes it can be tricky to debug. 

335
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:23,475
默认情况下,有些故障可能不太直观,
By default, and the ways it will fail sometimes are intuitive 

336
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:28,500
例如我们之前看到的"foo"命令不存在的方式.
like the way we saw before of like "foo" command not existing, sometimes it's not. 

337
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,600
因此,在课堂笔记中我们提供了一个叫做"shellcheck"的工具,
So there's like a really nifty tool that we have linked in the lecture notes, which is called "shellcheck", 

338
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,400
它可以为你提供警告、语法错误
that will kind of give you both warnings and syntactic errors

339
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,600
和其他可能不正确引用
and other things that you might not have quoted properly,

340
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,975
或文件中错放空格的问题.
or you might have misplaced spaces in your files. 

341
00:25:46,975 --> 00:25:54,450
例如,对于非常简单的"mcd.sh"文件,我们会得到一些错误提示,
So for example for extremely simple "mcd.sh" file we gonna hava a couple of errors saying hey, 

342
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,225
令人惊讶的是,我们缺少了shebang,
surprisingly,we're missing a shebang, 

343
00:25:56,225 --> 00:26:00,675
如果在不同的系统上运行,可能无法正确解释它.
like this might not interpret it correctly if you're running it at a different system. 

344
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:07,325
此外,这个"cd"命令可能不会正确扩展,
Also, this "cd" is taking a command and it might not expand properly 

345
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:11,060
因此,与其使用"cd",不如使用其他方法
so instead of using "cd" you might want to use something 

346
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,160
像是使用类似于"cd ... || exit"这样的东西.
like "cd ... || exit". 

347
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,411
我们回到之前解释的内容,
We go back to what we explained earlier, 

348
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:21,325
这样做的效果就是,如果"cd"没有正确执行,
what this will do is like if the "cd" doesn't end correctly, 

349
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:25,850
你不能"cd"进入该文件夹,因为要么你没有权限,要么它不存在...
you cannot "cd" into the folder because either you don't have permissions, it doesn't exist...

350
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,800
这将返回一个非0的错误代码,
That will give a nonzero error command, 

351
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,275
脚本将执行"exit",这将停止脚本的运行,
so you will execute "exit" and that will stop the script

352
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:39,100
而不是继续执行好像你实际上并不在的地方.
instead of continue executing as if you were in a place that you are actually not in. 

353
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:42,537
实际上,我还没有测试过,
And actually I haven't tested, 

354
00:26:42,537 --> 00:26:47,775
但我认为我们可以检查"example.sh",
but I think we can check for the "example.sh"

355
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:54,625
在这里我们得到的是我们应该以不同的方式检查退出代码,
and here we're getting that we should be checking the exit code in a different way, 

356
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:58,625
因为这种方法可能不是最好的方法.
because it's probably not the best way, doing it this way.  

357
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:07,575
我还想强调一点,在编写bash脚本或函数时,
One last remark I want to make is that when you're writing bash scripts or functions for that matter,

358
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:16,700
直接运行的脚本/函数和要载入shell的脚本/函数是有区别的
there's kind of a difference between writing bash scripts in isolation   like a thing that you're gonna run, and a thing that you're gonna load into your Shell.

359
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,950
我们将在命令行环境讲座中看到一些内容,
We will see some of this in the command line environment lecture, 

360
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,800
那里我们将会处理bashrc和sshrc.
where we will kind of be tooling with the bashrc and the sshrc. 

361
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,325
但总的来说,如果你对例如你所在的所在路径进行更改,
But in general, if you make changes to 

362
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:36,050
例如如果你"cd"进入一个bash脚本并且只执行该bash脚本,
for example where you are, like if you "cd" into a bash script and you just execute that bash script, 

363
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,075
这个脚本就不会"cd"进入你现在所在的shell.
it won't "cd" into the Shell are right now. 

364
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:45,325
但是,如果你直接将代码加载到你的shell中,例如你加载......
But if you have loaded the code directly into your Shell, for example we load the...

365
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:49,225
你找到函数并执行该函数,
You source the function and then you execute the function 

366
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:51,293
那么它就可以直接在你当前路径执行.
then you will get those side effects. 

367
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:55,625
同样的道理也适用于在shell中定义的变量.
And the same goes for defining variables into the Shell.

368
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:05,950
现在我将讨论一些我认为在处理shell时非常好用的工具.
Now I gonna kind of talk about some tools that I think are nifty when working with the Shell. 

369
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,250
这也是昨天简单介绍过的.
The first was also briefly introduced yesterday.

370
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,500
你如何知道使用哪些选项或确切的命令.
How do you know what flags, or like what exact commands can go

371
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,475
比如我该如何知道"ls -l"会以列表格式列出文件,
like how I am supposed to know that "ls -l" will list the files in a list format, 

372
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:26,725
或者如果我执行"mv -i",它会提示我输入内容.
or that if I do "mv - i", it's gonna like prom me for stuff. 

373
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,500
为此,你可以使用"man"命令.
For that what you have is the "man" command. 

374
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,100
"man"命令会提供很多帮助信息...
And the "man" command will kind of have   like a lot of information of how will you go about... 

375
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,025
例如在这里它会解释"-i"选项
so for example here it will explain for the "-i" flag, 

376
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:42,700
有哪些可选项.
there are all these options you can do. 

377
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
这其实非常有用,
That's actually pretty useful and it will work 

378
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,525
不仅适用于你操作系统中打包好的简单命令,
not only for really simple commands that come packaged with your OS

379
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:56,600
而且还适用于你从互联网上安装的一些工具.
but will also work with some tools that you install from the internet for example

380
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,900
例如,如果进行安装的人同时安装了"man"包,
if the person that did the installation made it so that the "man" package were also installed. 

381
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,025
那么比如我们稍后要介绍的一个名为"ripgrep"的工具,
So for example a tool that we're gonna cover in a bit

382
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:11,375
它的命令叫做"rg",
which is called "ripgrep" and is called with "rg", 

383
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:13,994
这并没有与我的系统一起提供,
and this didn't come with my system 

384
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:18,975
但它一同安装了自己的"man"页面,我可以访问它.
but it has installed its own man page and I have it here and I can access it. 

385
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:23,950
对于某些命令,"man"页面是有用的,
For some commands the man page is useful 

386
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,625
但有时它又不太方便,
but sometimes it can be tricky to decipher 

387
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,075
因为它更像是一份文档或是描述工具
because it's more kind of a documentation 

388
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:33,400
关于所能做的所有事情的说明.
and a description of all the things the tool can do. 

389
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,500
有时它会有示例,但有时不会,
Sometimes it will have examples but sometimes not, 

390
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,275
有时工具可以做很多事情,
and sometimes the tool can do a lot of things. 

391
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:47,475
比如我经常使用的一些好工具是"convert"或"ffmpeg",
So a couple of good tools that I use commonly are "convert" or "ffmpeg", 

392
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:51,975
它们分别处理图像和视频,"man"页内容巨多.
which deal with images and video respectively and the "man" pages are like enormous. 

393
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
你还可以安装一个很好的,叫做"tldr"的工具,
So there's one neat tool called "tldr" that you can install 

394
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,612
然后你就可以得到一些很好的例子,
and you will have like some nice kind of explanatory examples of 

395
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,900
来解释如何使用这个命令.
how you want to use this command. 

396
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,209
当然你也可以随时在谷歌上搜索,
And you can always Google for this, 

397
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:10,925
但我发现我总是要先进入浏览器,
but I find myself saving going into the browser, 

398
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:16,825
查找一些例子,然后再回来(这很慢~),而"tldr"是社区贡献的,
looking about some examples and coming back, whereas "tldr" are community contributed 

399
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:19,000
使用"tldr"效率就非常高.
and they're fairly useful. 

400
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,965
然后,"ffmpeg"的页面有很多有用的例子,
Then, the one for "ffmpeg" has a lot of useful examples 

401
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,550
这些例子的格式也很美观
that are more nicely formatted 

402
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,025
如果你特意用大号字体的话.
if you don't have a huge font size for recording. 

403
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:35,450
甚至于像"tar"这样的简单命令,有很多选项需要组合使用.
Or even simple commands like "tar", that have a lot of options that you are combining. 

404
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:40,875
例如,在这里,你可以组合2、3个不同的flag,
So for example, here you can be combining 2, 3... different flags 

405
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:45,425
当你想组合不同的flag时,这可能不是很直观
and it can not be obvious, when you want to combine different ones. 

406
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:52,175
"tldr"就可以帮助你你了解更多有关这些工具.
That's how you would go about finding more about these tools. 

407
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:58,350
让我们尝试学习如何查找文件.
On the topic of finding, let's try learning how to find files. 

408
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:08,425
你可以随时使用ls,比如ls project1,并不断ls到底.
You can always go "ls", and like you can go like "ls project1", and keep LS'ing all the way through. 

409
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:17,175
但是,也许如果我们已经知道我们要查找所有名为"src"的文件夹,
But maybe, if we already know that we want to look for all the folders called "src", 

410
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:20,225
那么可能有更好的命令来完成这个任务.
then there's probably a better command for doing that. 

411
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,425
这就是"find".
And that's "find".

412
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,525
"find"是几乎每个UNIX系统都带有的工具.
"find" is the tool that, pretty much comes with every UNIX system. 

413
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:30,250
我们要将把"find"用在...
And "find", we're gonna give it... 

414
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:36,548
我们将在当前文件夹中调用 "find" ,
here we're saying we want to call "find" in the current folder, 

415
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,375
别忘了 "." 表示当前文件夹,
remember that "." stands for the current folder, 

416
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:44,975
我们要让它的名称是"src",类型为文件夹.
and we want the name to be "src" and we want the type to be a directory. 

417
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:50,625
通过输入这个命令,它将递归地浏览当前文件夹,
And by typing that it's gonna recursively go through the current directory 

418
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:55,350
并查找所有符合此标准的文件或文件夹.
and look for all these files, or folders in this case, that match this pattern. 

419
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,700
"find"有很多有用的标志.
"find" has a lot of useful flags. 

420
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:04,800
例如,你甚至可以查询特定模式的文件路径.
So for example, you can even test for the path to be in a way. 

421
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,425
以便说我们希望有一些文件夹,
Here we're saying we want some number of folders,

422
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:10,225
我们并不在意有多少文件夹,
we don't really care how many folders,

423
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:13,750
然后我们想要的是所有的Python脚本,
and then we care about all the Python scripts, 

424
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,873
所有的扩展名为".py"的东西,
all the things with the extension ".py",

425
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,600
这些都需要在一个名为"test"的文件夹中.
 that are within a test folder. 

426
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,821
而且,我们也检查一下,只是以防万一,
And we're also checking, just in cases really 

427
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:23,025
但我们只是检查一下它也是"f"(文件)类型
but we're checking just that it's also are...

428
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,400
按下f键,这代表文件
type "f", which stands for file. 

429
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:28,200
我们正在获取所有符合条件的文件.
We're getting all these files.

430
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,500
你还可以使用不是路径或名称的其他标志.
You can also use different flags for things that are not the path or the name.

431
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,325
比如你可以检查已修改过的文件
You could check things that have been modified 

432
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,550
"-mtime"用于修改时间,
"-mtime" is for the modification time, 

433
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,350
在过去一天内修改过的文件,这几乎将是所有文件.
things that have been modified in the last day, which is gonna be pretty much .

434
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,225
因此,这将打印
Everything ,so this is gonna print

435
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:50,950
我们今天创建的许多文件和已经存在的文件.
a lot of the files we created and files that were already there. 

436
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:57,700
你甚至可以使用其他东西,例如大小,所有者,权限等.
You can even use other things like size, the owner, permissions, you name it. 

437
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,150
更强大的是,"find"不仅可以查找东西,
What is even more powerful is, "find" can find stuff

438
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,875
它也可以在找到这些文件时执行一些操作.
but it also can do stuff when you find those files. 

439
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:15,250
因此,我们可以查找所有具有"tmp"扩展名的文件,
So we could look for all the files that have a "tmp" extension, 

440
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:22,850
然后,我们可以告诉"find"对于这些文件中的每一个文件,
which is a temporary extension, and then, we can tell "find" that like for every one of those files,

441
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,500
只需为它们执行"rm"命令.
just execute the "rm" command for them. 

442
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,150
这将调用"rm"来处理所有这些文件.
And that will just be calling "rm" with all these files. 

443
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:36,050
因此,让我们首先执行这个,然后再执行这个.
So let's first execute it without, and then we execute it with it.

444
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,050
再次,与命令行哲学一样,看起来好像什么也没发生.
Again, as with the command line philosophy, it looks like nothing happened. 

445
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:48,875
但是由于我们有零错误代码,所以命令还是都执行了
But since we have a "0" error code, something happened 

446
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,350
只是一切都正确,一切都好.
just that everything went correct and everything is fine. 

447
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,700
现在,如果我们搜索这些文件,它们就已经被删除了.
And now, if we look for these files, they aren't there anymore.

448
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:04,350
一般来说,关于Shell的另一个好处是不仅有这些工具,
Another nice thing about the Shell in general is that there are these tools, 

449
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,500
而且人们会不断发现新的方法,
but people will keep finding new ways, 

450
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,400
所以会有替代的方法来编写这些工具.
so alternative ways of writing these tools. 

451
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:20,075
了解它非常好.例如,如果你只想匹配以"tmp"结尾的内容,
It's nice to know about it. So, for example "find" if you just want to match like the things that end in "tmp"

452
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:24,375
可能很难做到这一点,因为它有很长的命令.
it can be sometimes weird to do this thing, it has a long command.

453
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:29,000
所以就有了"fd"这样的东西,
There's things like "fd" for example

454
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:34,850
这是一个更短的命令,它默认使用正则表达式,并忽略你的git文件,
that is a shorter command that by default will use regex and will ignore your gitfiles, 

455
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,225
因此你甚至不会搜索它们.
so you don't even search for them. 

456
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,875
它会用不同的颜色显示代码,更好地支持Unicode编码...
It will color-code, it will have better Unicode support... 

457
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,325
了解一些这些工具是很好的.
It's nice to know about some of these tools. 

458
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:51,350
但是,再次强调的是,如果你知道这些工具的存在,
But, again, the main idea is that if you are aware that these tools exist, 

459
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:56,575
你可以节省大量时间,不必做一些繁琐重复的任务.
you can save yourself a lot of time from doing kind of menial and repetitive tasks.

460
00:34:56,575 --> 00:35:00,850
还有一个命令要记住,就像"find"一样.
Another command to bear in mind is like "find". 

461
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,775
有些人可能会想,
Some of you may be wondering, 

462
00:35:02,775 --> 00:35:09,075
"find"可能只是实际上在遍历目录结构并寻找内容,
"find" is probably just actually going through a directory structure and looking for the things 

463
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:11,650
但如果我一天要做很多"find",那怎么办?
but what if I'm doing a lot of "find"s a day?

464
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,675
是否更好,采用数据库方法并首先构建一个索引,
Wouldn't it be better, doing kind of a database approach and build an index first, 

465
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:21,050
然后让该索引以某种方式进行更新.
and then use that index and update it in some way. 

466
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,475
实际上,大多数Unix系统已经通过"locate"命令完成了这一点,
Well, actually most Unix systems already do it and this is through the "locate" command

467
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:32,262
而且"locate"将被用来... 
and the way that the "locate" will be used... 

468
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:40,150
"locate"只会查找你的文件系统中包含你想要的子字符串的路径.
it will just look for paths in your file system that have the substring that you work. 

469
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,050
我实际上不知道它是否有效...
I actually don't know if it will work... 

470
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,650
好的,它有效.
Okay, it worked. 

471
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:49,825
让我试试像"missing-semester"这样的东西.
Let me try to do something like "missing-semester".

472
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,300
它会花一些时间,但它找到了所有这些文件,这些文件都在我的文件系统中某个地方,
You're gonna take a while but it found all these files that are somewhere in my file system 

473
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,400
因为它已经在它们上面构建了一个索引,所以它要快得多.
and since it has built an index already on them, it's much faster. 

474
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,776
为了使其保持更新,
And then, to keep it updated, 

475
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:09,275
我们可以使用"updatedb"命令来更新此数据库.
using the "updatedb" command 

476
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:15,725
这正是通过"cron"[*]运行的
that is running through "cron", to update this database. 
*[Cron是一种在Unix、Linux和类Unix操作系统中用于定期运行任务的工具。  它允许用户指定一个或多个命令或脚本，并设置在指定时间或周期运行这些命令或脚本的方式。]

477
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:19,525
再次强调,查找文件真的很有用
Finding files, again, is really useful. 

478
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,625
有时你实际上关心的不是文件本身,
Sometimes you're actually concerned about, not the files themselves,

479
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,650
而是文件的内容.
but the content of the files. 

480
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:32,575
为此,你可以使用我们迄今为止看到的"grep"命令.
For that you can use the "grep" command that we have seen so far. 

481
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:38,525
因此,你可以在"mcd.sh"中执行类似"grep foobar"的操作,它就在那里.
So you could do something like "grep foobar" in "mcd.sh", it's there.

482
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:45,700
如果你想要再次递归地搜索当前结构并查找更多文件,怎么办?
What if you want to, again, recursively search through the current structure and look for more files?

483
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,975
我们不想手动完成这项工作.
We don't want to do this manually.

484
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,025
我们可以使用"find"和"-exec",
We could use "find", and the "-exec", 

485
00:36:51,025 --> 00:37:02,550
但实际上,"grep"具有"-R"标志,它将遍历整个目录.
but actually "grep" has the "-R" flag that will go through the entire directory, here. 

486
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,325
"example.sh"中这三行有包含"foobar"
And it's telling us that oh we have the "foobar" line in "example.sh"

487
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,800
另外两个文件也有两行也有含"foobar".
at these three places and in this other two places in foobar. 

488
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:15,975
这非常方便.
This can be really convenient. 

489
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:22,675
主要用例是,你知道你已经在某种编程语言中编写了一些代码,
Mainly, kind of the use case for this is you know you have written some code in some programming language, 

490
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:26,850
并且知道它在你的文件系统的某个地方,但你实际上不知道在哪里.
and you know it's somewhere in your file system but you actually don't know. 

491
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,175
你就可以快速搜索.
But you can actually quickly search.

492
00:37:29,175 --> 00:37:38,575
例如,我可以在"scratch"文件夹中
So for example, I can quickly search for all the Python files 

493
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:45,600
快速搜索导入了"requests"库的所有Python文件.
that I have in my scratch folder where I used the request library.

494
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:51,300
如果我运行这个命令,它会通过所有这些文件,
And if I run this, it's giving me through all these files, exactly in

495
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,425
并精确地给出在哪一行找到了它.
what line it has been found. 

496
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:58,375
这里,我没有使用"grep",(当然这也是可以的)
And here instead of using "grep", which is fine, you could also do this, 

497
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:03,325
而是使用了"ripgrep",它与"grep"的想法有点相同,
I'm using "ripgrep", which is kind of the same idea 

498
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:12,750
但是"ripgrep"更好康,比如彩色编码或文件处理等.
but again trying to bring some more niceties like color coding or file processing and other things. 

499
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,325
它也支持unicode.
It think it has, also, unicode support. 

500
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:21,425
但是你不必担心他因为这些功能而速度会慢,它查找速度也很快.
It's also pretty fast so you are not paying like a trade-off on this being slower 

501
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:25,216
还有许多有用的标志.
and there's a lot of useful flags. 

502
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:30,550
你可以说,哦,我实际上想获得这些结果周围的一些上下文.
You can say, oh, I actually want to get some context around those results.

503
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:37,275
因此,你可以看到导入所在的位置
So I want to get like five lines of context around that, 

504
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:43,025
并查看周围的代码.
so you can see where that import lives and see code around it.

505
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,343
在导入中,这并不是真正有用的,
Here in the import it's not really useful 

506
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:47,868
但是如果你正在寻找使用该函数的位置,
but like if you're looking for where you use the function, for example, 

507
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,475
那么它将非常方便.
It will be very handy. 

508
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:59,025
我们还可以做其他事情,例如在这里搜索.
We can also do things like we can search, for example here,.

509
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:09,625
更高级的用法,我们可以说,"-u"是为了不忽略隐藏文件,
A more advanced use, we can say, "-u" is for don't ignore hidden files, 

510
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:16,000
有时你想忽略隐藏文件,
sometimes you want to be ignoring hidden files, 

511
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,625
除非你要搜索默认隐藏的配置文件.
except if you want to search config files, that are by default hidden. 

512
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,075
然后,我们不是打印匹配项,
Then, instead of printing the matches, 

513
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:31,525
而是要求执行一些可能很难使用"grep"实现的操作
we're asking to do something that would be kind of hard, I think,to do with "grep", out of my head, 

514
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:37,250
比如"我希望你打印出所有不匹配给定模式的文件",
which is I want you to print all the files that don't match the pattern I'm giving you, 

515
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:41,800
这可能是一个奇怪的要求,但请你们继续看...
which may be a weird thing to ask here but then we keep going... 

516
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,125
这里的模式是一个正则表达式,
And this pattern here is a small regex 

517
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,514
它表示在行的开头有一个"#"和一个"!",这是一个shebang.
which is saying at the beginning of the line I have a "#" and a "!", and that's a shebang.

518
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:57,100
这样,我们在这里搜索所有没有shebang的文件,
Like that, we're searching here for all the files that don't have a shebang

519
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,415
然后在这里给它一个"-t sh"表示只查找"sh"文件,
and then we're giving it, here, a "-t sh" to only look for "sh" files,  

520
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:09,000
因为你的Python或文本文件可能没有shebang也没问题.
because maybe all your Python or text files are fine without a shebang. 

521
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:12,875
这里告诉我们,"哦,mcd.sh显然缺少一个shebang",
And here it's telling us "oh, 'mcd.sh' is obviously missing a shebang"

522
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,775
我们甚至可以... 
We can even... 

523
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:21,425
它有一些不错的标志,例如如果我们包括"--stats"标志,
It has like some nice flags, so for example if we include the "--stats" flag

524
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:35,050
它将得到所有这些结果,它还会告诉我们有关它所搜索的所有内容的信息.
it will get all these results but it will also tell us information about all the things that it searched. 

525
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,900
例如,找到的匹配次数、行数、搜索的文件、
For example, the number of matches that it found, the lines, the file searched,

526
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,775
打印的字节数等等.
the bytes that it printed, etc.

527
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:47,675
与"fd"类似,它有时候不是很好用
Similar as with "fd", sometimes it's not as useful

528
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:52,700
有时候特定的工具并不是很有用,就跟"ripgrep"一样,
using one specific tool or another and in fact, as "ripgrep", 

529
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:58,425
还有像"ack"这样的工具是最初编写的"grep"替代工具.
there are several other tools, like "ack", you know, is kind of the original "grep" alternative that was written. 

530
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:03,350
然后是另一个工具"ag".
Then the silver searcher, "ag", was another one... 

531
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,850
它们都可以相互替换,
and they're all pretty much interchangeable

532
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,625
所以也许你所在的系统有其中一个而没有另一个,
so maybe you're at a system that has one and not the other, 

533
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:13,800
你只要知道你可以使用这些非常好用的工具.
just knowing that you can use these things with these tools can be fairly useful. 

534
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,450
最后,我想谈谈如何查找你已经使用过的命令,不是找文件或代码.
Lastly, I want to cover how you go about, not finding files or code, 

535
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,525
就是你如何找到你已经使用过的命令.
but how you go about finding commands that you already some time figured out. 

536
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:30,525
第一种,显然的方法就是使用"↑",
The first, obvious way is just using the up arrow,

537
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:34,675
慢慢浏览你的历史记录,寻找这些匹配项.
and slowly going through all your history, looking for these matches.

538
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,650
这实际上并不是很高效,你可能已经猜到了.
This is actually not very efficient, as you probably guessed. 

539
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:43,025
因此,bash有更轻松的方法来做这件事.
So the bash has ways to do this more easily.

540
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:45,900
有一个history命令,会打印出你的历史记录.
There is the "history" command, that will print your history. 

541
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,300
这里我在zsh中,它只打印出一部分历史记录,
Here I'm in zsh and it only prints some of my history, 

542
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,575
但如果我说,我想要你从一切开始打印,
but if I say, I want you to print everything from the beginning of time, 

543
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:57,325
它将从这个历史记录的开始打印一切.
it will print everything from the beginning of whatever this history is.

544
00:41:57,325 --> 00:42:02,225
由于这是很多结果,也许我们关心的是
And since this is a lot of results, maybe we care about the ones 

545
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:05,204
我们使用"convert"命令
where we use the "convert" command

546
00:42:05,204 --> 00:42:08,925
使其从某种文件类型转换为另一种文件类型.
 to go from some type of file to some other type of file.

547
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:11,125
一些图片....呃
Some image, sorry. 

548
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:18,250
然后,我们获得了所有与该子字符串匹配的结果.
Then, we're getting all these results here, about all the ones that match this substring.

549
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:29,250
几乎所有的shell默认都会将"Ctrl+R"这个键绑定为反向搜索.
Even more, pretty much all Shells by default will link "Ctrl+R", the keybinding, to do backward search. 

550
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,425
这里我们有一个反向搜索,我们可以输入"convert",
Here we have backward search, where we can type "convert" 

551
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,050
它会找到我们刚输入的命令.
and it's finding the command that we just typed. 

552
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,500
如果我们一直按"Ctrl+R",
And if we just keep hitting "Ctrl+R", 

553
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:45,250
它会浏览这些匹配项,让我们在原地重新执行.
it will kind of go through these matches and it will let re-execute it in place. 

554
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,486
另外一件你可以做的与此相关的事情,
Another thing that you can do, related to that,

555
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:53,375
是你可以使用这个非常棒的工具叫做"fzf",
 is you can use this really nifty tool called "fzf", 

556
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:56,792
"fzf"就像一个模糊查找器,它可以然你...
which is like a fuzzy finder, like it will let you...

557
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,275
它可以让你进行交互式的 "grep".
It will let you do kind of like an interactive "grep". 

558
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:09,350
例如,我们可以执行cat example.sh,
We could do for example this, where we can cat our "example.sh" command, 

559
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,350
它将打印到标准输出,
that will print print to the standard output, 

560
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,550
并将其传递到 "fzf" 中.
and then we can pipe it through "fzf". 

561
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,126
它只是获取所有的行,
It's just getting all the lines 

562
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:20,425
然后我们可以交互式地查找我们关心的字符串.
and then we can interactively look for the string that we care about. 

563
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:23,700
"fzf"的好处是,
And the nice thing about fzf is that, 

564
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:33,675
如果你启用了默认绑定,它会绑定到你的"Ctrl+R" shell执行,
if you enable the default bindings, it will bind to your "Ctrl+R" Shell execution 

565
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:37,958
现在你可以快速动态地查找
and now you can quickly and dynamically like look for 

566
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:41,750
所有你尝试在历史记录中转换"favicon"的时间.
all the times you try to convert a favicon in your history.

567
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,925
它还具有模糊匹配的功能,.
And it's also like fuzzy matching, 

568
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,406
必须编写一个正则表达式或一些表达式来匹配
whereas like by default in "grep" or these things 

569
00:43:47,406 --> 00:43:52,475
而默认情况下"grep"或这些工具
you have to write a regex or some expression that will match within here.

570
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,975
这里我只是输入"convert"和"favi",
Here I'm just typing "convert" and "favi" 

571
00:43:54,975 --> 00:44:00,000
它尝试做出最佳扫描,在它拥有的行中进行匹配.
and it's just trying to do the best scan, doing the match in the lines it has.

572
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,350
最后,一个你可能已经见过的工具,
Lastly, a tool that probably you have already seen, 

573
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:09,441
我用它来避免重新输入这些非常长的命令,
that I've been using for not retyping these extremely long commands 

574
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,300
它叫做"history substring search",
is this "history substring search", 

575
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,925
当我在shell中输入时,
where as I type in my Shell, 

576
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:19,000
虽然两个查找方法("find","fd")都没有提到,
and both f fail to mention 

577
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,975
但是有个的概念一开始就已经引入这两个方面
but both face which I think was originally introduced, this concept, 

578
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:25,375
然后zsh有一个非常好的实现,
and then zsh has a really nice implementation 

579
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:28,700
它让你在键入命令时,
What it'll let you do is as you type the command, 

580
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:34,700
动态地在历史记录中搜索具有相同前缀的相同命令,
it will dynamically like search back in your history to the same command that has a common prefix,

581
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,500
然后,如果你...
and then, if you...

582
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:45,550
它会随着匹配列表停止工作而改变,然后当你按"→"”时,
it will change as the match list stops working and then as you do the right arrow. 

583
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,325
你可以选择那个命令,然后重新执行它.
you can select that command and then re-execute it.

584
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,175
我们已经看到了一些东西...
We've seen a bunch of stuff... 

585
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:11,650
我想我还有几分钟的时间,
I think I have a few minutes left 

586
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:19,950
所以我要介绍一些快速目录列表和目录导航的工具.
so I'm going to cover a couple of tools to do   kind of really quick directory listing and directory navigation.

587
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:30,525
你总是可以使用"-R"来递归地列出某个目录结构,
So you can always use the "-R" to recursively list some directory structure,

588
00:45:30,525 --> 00:45:35,300
但这可能不是最优的,这不是很好理解.
but that can be suboptimal, I cannot really make sense of this easily.

589
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:45,775
有一个叫做"tree"的工具,它更友好地打印目录结构,
There's tool called "tree" that will be the much more friendly form of printing all the stuff, 

590
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:47,600
它也会根据不同的类型进行着色...
it will also color code based on...

591
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,000
例如,这里的"foo"是蓝色的,因为它是一个目录,
here for example "foo" is blue because it's a directory 

592
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
这个是红色的,因为它有执行权限.
and this is red because it has execute permissions.

593
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:58,175
但我们可以做得更好.
But we can go even further than that. 

594
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:00,166
有一些很好的工具,
There's really nice tools 

595
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:04,325
比如最近出现的一个叫做"broot"的工具,它可以做同样的事情,
like a recent one called "broot" that will do the same thing 

596
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:08,400
但是在这里,不像列出每一个单独的文件,
but here for example instead of doing this thing of listing every single file, 

597
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,550
例如在"bar"中,我们有这些"a"到"j"的文件,
for example in bar we have these "a" through "j" files,

598
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,375
它会说"噢,还有更多,这里就不列举了".
it will say "oh there are more, unlisted here".

599
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:22,175
我实际上可以开始输入,它会再次匹配到那些存在的文件,
I can actually start typing and it will again facily match to the files that are there

600
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:24,925
我可以快速选择它们并浏览它们.
and I can quickly select them and navigate through them.

601
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:30,300
因此,了解这些事情很重要,
So, again, it's good to know that these things exist 

602
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:36,000
这样你就不会浪费大量时间去寻找这些文件.
so you don't lose a large amount of time going for these files.

603
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:45,292
还有,我认为我也安装了一些你希望操作系统拥有的工具,
There are also, I think I have it installed also something more similar to what you would expect your OS to have,

604
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:48,710
比如Nautilus或者其中一个Mac Finder,
like Nautilus or one of the Mac finders 

605
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:59,400
它们有一个交互式的界面,你可以使用箭头快速浏览.
that have like an interactive input where you can just use your navigation arrows and quickly explore.

606
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:00,900
这可能有点过度了,
It might be overkill 

607
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:07,800
但你会惊讶地发现,通过浏览某个目录结构,你可以很快地理解它.
but you'll be surprised how quickly you can make sense of some directory structure by just navigating through it.

608
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:16,525
几乎所有这些工具去看看选项,都可以让你编辑、复制文件……
And pretty much all of these tools will let you edit, copy files...  if you just look for the options for them.

609
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:20,700
最后的补充内容有点复杂.
The last addendum is kind of going places.

610
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:29,000
我们有"cd","cd"很好用,它会让你到达很多地方.
We have "cd", and "cd" is nice, it will get you to a lot of places. 

611
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,775
但是如果你可以快速到达一些地方,还有更方便地方法.
But it's pretty handy if you can like quickly go places,

612
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:33,922
具体地说,就是
you are...

613
00:47:33,922 --> 00:47:38,275
你最近或经常去的地方
either you have been to recently or that you go frequently. 

614
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:43,200
你可以用很多种方式做到这一点,可能会想到……
And you can do this in many ways there's probably you can start thinking, 

615
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,025
我可以做书签,我可以……
oh I can make bookmarks, I can make... 

616
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:48,550
我可以在shell中创建别名,我们以后会介绍到这个问题,
I can make aliases in the Shell, that we will cover at some point,

617
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,625
可以创建符号链接……
symlinks... 

618
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,700
但是此时,程序员已经构建了所有这些工具,
But at this point ,programmers have like built all these tools, 

619
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,525
所以程序员已经找到了一个非常好的方法来做到这一点.
so programmers have already figured out a really nice way of doing this.

620
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:03,700
其中一种方法是使用所谓的"auto jump",
One way of doing this is using what is called "auto jump", 

621
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,050
我想这里没有加载……
which I think is not loaded here...

622
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,925
不过,别担心.
Okay, don't worry. 

623
00:48:16,925 --> 00:48:19,725
我将在命令行环境中介绍它.
I will cover it in the command line environment.

624
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,750
我想这是因为我禁用了"Ctrl+R",
I think it's because I disabled the "Ctrl+R" 

625
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,100
这也影响了脚本的其他部分.
and that also affected other parts of the script. 

626
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,100
如果有任何与此相关的问题,
I think at this point if anyone has any questions that are related to this, 

627
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,075
如果有任何不清楚的地方,我很乐意回答.
I'll be more than happy to answer them,  if anything was left unclear.

628
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,375
如果没有的话,我们编写了一堆关于这些工具的练习,
Otherwise, there's a bunch of exercises that we wrote, kind of touching on these topics 

629
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,925
我们鼓励你尝试它们,并在办公时间前来,
and we encourage you to try them and come to office hours, 

630
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,871
我们可以帮助你弄清如何做这些事情,
where we can help you figure out how to do them, 

631
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:54,496
或者一些你不明确的bash技巧.
or some like bash quirks that are not clear.
